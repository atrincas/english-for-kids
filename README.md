As workflow:

- Add feature or improve feature

## Our agile workflow and Trello board

We try to break down the tasks for the project and also we try to build app in an incremental way.

In order to accomplish our tasks in a proper way we have created a trello board. Also another reason why we created the trello board is to clarify the collaboration process.
