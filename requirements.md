Build a application that teach basic English words for children.
​
The webapp must be built using React and Redux.

# Features

1. The webapp will show a quiz with a number of questions. Each question will display an image of an object. The user has to choose the correct Englis word from a list of 4 options.
​
2. When the user makes the correct choice, the chosen option and the image will be highlighted with a green color. After a short time-out the app will proceed to the next question.

3. If the user makes the wrong choice, the chosen option and the image will be highlighted with a red color.

4. The app must keep track of the user's performance and progress.

5. When the quiz is finished the user will see his performance (to be determined).
